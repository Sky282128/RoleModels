    "The dataset includes national-level data from the Philippines showcasing the **percentage share of total family income and total family expenditure**, disaggregated by **each region, province, and highly urbanized city (HUC)** for the years **2018**, **2021**, and **2023**. These figures allow for data analysis in the trends of income distribution and household spending behavior across each geographic locations and time period in the Philippines.\n",

    "### **How the Dataset Was Collected**  \n",
    "The dataset was collected by the **Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA)** as part of their **Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES)**. The FIES is conducted every three years using techniques such as probability sampling to gather economic data across the country. The Surveys are administered in person by PSA field staffs.\n",

    "### **Potential Implications of Data Collection**  \n",
    "Since the survey relies on **self-reported data**, responses may be affected by **recall bias or underreporting**, especially on sensitive financial matters. Additionally, regions that are remote and households in the informal sector may have underpresented and inconsistent data due to logistical, economic, and social reasons. Factors such as these mentioned can affect the accuracy and generalizability of the income and expenditure shares reported in the dataset.\n",
